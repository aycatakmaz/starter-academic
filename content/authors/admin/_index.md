I am a Master’s student in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology at ETH Zurich, in Zurich, Switzerland. During my studies at ETH Zurich, I have had a specialization in computer vision, machine learning, signal processing and virtual reality. 
I have also undertaken several research projects at the Computer Vision and Graphics Lab (CVG) and Computer Vision Lab (CVL) at ETH Zürich. I completed my Master's thesis in the field of unsupervised, monocular depth estimation in non-rigid scenes, under the supervision of Dr. Danda Pani Paudel, Dr. Thomas Probst, Dr. Ajad Chhatkuli, and Prof. Luc Van Gool.

Prior to my Master's studies, I was an undergraduate student in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey. I also had the opportunity to visit École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) at Lausanne, Switzerland, for my exchange studies.
